Computer-aided analysis consists of a set of procedures and computer programs specifically designed to aid in the process of applications software design, computer selection and performance evaluation. There are four major components: Problem Statement Language, Problem Statement Analyzer, Generator of Alternative Designs, and Performance Evaluator. The statement of requirements was written in ADS (Accurately Defined Systems) and analyzed by a Problem Statement Analyzer for ADS. The ADS problem definition was supplemented with additional information in order to create a complete problem definition. The analyzed problem statement was translated to the form necessary for use by the SODA (Systems Optimization and Design Algorithm) program for the generation of alternative specifications of program modules and logical database structures.", "label": "cacm"}

{"raw": "Design and Evaluation of Information Systems The co-joining of \"design\" with \"evaluation\" that is called for by this chapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for the author. In part, \"design\" and \"evaluation\" prescribe two separate sets of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and testing of new information system structures and modification of existing structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational systems and system components. However, \"design\" includes not only the formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for evaluation in accordance with expectations. \"Evaluation\" applies to testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the appraisal of operating systems. Appraisals at any stage of system operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications that require redesign and assessment. Thus, portions of \"design\" and \"evaluation\" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in his 1969 review. \"Design\" and \"evaluation\" may be examined methodologically or with respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies. Increasingly, designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations. The current literature discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on their products.", "label": "cisi"}

These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications. Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed. Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers.

Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6 have proved to be solid and important. For example, the movement toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally) held data. Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination systems. This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes. It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define the potential and problems of some of the promising new media. Other new areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal justice system and information system applications in the humanities. In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description and representation, and organization of information.

The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that meets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically expressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural spelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity for extensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string inverted index greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables long strings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage.. Creation of \"reduced\" files and tables is an important feature of a program; it allows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time..", "label": "cisi"}

As the coverage of the grammar is increased, an efficient representation becomes essential for further development. This paper presents a programming language designed specifically for the compact and perspicuous statement of restrictions of a natural language grammar. It is based on ten years' experience parsing text sentences with the comprehensive English grammar of the N.Y.U.

Although not every diagram is decomposable into a finite number of given base diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level due to a suitable extension of the given set and of the basic mappings defined in it. Two normalization methods of flow diagrams are given. The first has three base diagrams; the second, only two. In the second part of the paper, the second method is applied to the theory of Turing machines. With every Turing machine provided with a two-way half-tape, there is associated a similar machine, doing essentially the same job, but working on a tape obtained from the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares. The new machine belongs to the family, elsewhere introduced, generated by composition and iteration from the two machines L and R.
